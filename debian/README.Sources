GIT Usage
---------

 I've updated this package such that only the debian/ tree is stored
 in git, which I think makes sense.

 For minor updates to the package we can get the orig.tar.gz via
 "apt-get source .."  For new releases we merely need to download
 the latest .zip and repack as jquery-x.y.z.orig.tar.gz - making
 no other changes.
